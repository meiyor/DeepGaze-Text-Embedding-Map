## DeepGaze-Text-Embedding-Map 
This repository includes the implementation of **DeepGaze** adding the **Text-Embedding-Maps** (TEM) [Barman et., al 2020,Yang et., al 2017]for predicting robustly human fixation/gaze.

We use a data intersection between COCO and SALICON to perform our evaluations 

For runnig the code first generate the TEM:

```python
python generate_TEM.py
```
